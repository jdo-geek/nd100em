The binary will run .bp format files, as well as stripped bpun files.
all configuration of start parameters is done through nd100em.conf file,
see instructions in the example file for examples of how to use it.

To run a particular program copy it first either to test.bpun or test.bp depending
on format, and then set the correct start address in config file.
For example, to run MAC: (start address 173415 octal)
copy NPL.bp to test.bp, and set config file to bp format, and start addess
63245.

Then run emulator with ./nd100em.

./nd100em

December 2024: Booting from Floppy

Current config is set to boot from floppy disk.
See nd100em.conf how to setup SINTRAN III

1) You need at least two raw Sintran III floppy images in the files
floppy.nd100.00.img and floppy.nd100.01.img
They can be created by "imd2raw < DISK1.IMD > floppy.nd100.00.img

2) Set the script_console in nd100em.conf to boot both floppies.
After some minutes the emulator should show:
"%% THE SINTRAN III SYSTEM MAY NOW BE STARTED BY TYPING 22!"
Press Ctrl-C to stop the emulator.

3) Set the script_console to 
script_console="LOAD MAC\r)HENT\r\r22!";
and start the emulator again. The system will be loaded, some device errors
will be shown. Press ESC and the ENTER will appear.

4) Use floppy.nd100.03.img as the raw image to read from other system floppies.
