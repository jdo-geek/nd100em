# \r:          carriage return
# \t0 ... \t9: use floppy.nd100.xx.img as image file
# \033:        escape
# Examples:
# Step 1:
# boot from floppy.nd100.00.img, load disk 0, load disk 1:
script_console="LOAD MAC\r10,0$\r\t110,0$";
# Step 2:
# boot from floppy, then load from safe area:
# script_console="LOAD MAC\r)HENT\r\t3\r22!";
